                  The story of LSD begins with <span class="highlight">Albert Hofmann</span>, a Swiss-born chemist. In 1938, Hofmann was working at Sandoz Laboratories, studying the medical plant Drimia maritima as well as Ergot fungus, as part of a program to synthesize the active constituents to be used as pharmaceuticals. When experimenting on creating respiratory and circulatory stimulants, Hofmann synthesized lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).

                  5 years after his initial discovery, Hofmann accidentally ingested LSD through his fingertips and experienced a sudden change of consciousness:

At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated-like condition, characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a dreamlike state, with eyes closed (I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring), I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colours.”

                  3 days later, Hofmann self-experimented, dosing himself with <span class="highlight">.25 milligrams</span> of LSD, assuming that would be a threshold dose. One hour later, Albert Hofmann was experiencing the first LSD trip. After his trip, Hofmann knew he had discovered something of significance, that LSD is a psychoactive substance with extraordinary potency, capable of causing significant shifts of consciousness in incredibly low doses.
