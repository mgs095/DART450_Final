                <p>Albert Hofmann was a Swiss-born chemist. In 1938, Hofmann was working at Sandoz Laboratories, studying the medical plant Drama maritime as well as ergot fungus, as part of a program to synthesize and purify the active constituents to be used as pharmaceuticals. When experimenting on creating respiratory and circulatory stimulants, Hofmann synthesized lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).
                </p>
                <p>5 years after his initial discovery, Hofmann accidentally ingested LSD through his fingertips and felt a sudden change of consciousness:
                </p> 
                <p>  
                    “affected by a remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness. At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated-like condition, characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a dreamlike state, with eyes closed (I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring), I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colours.”
                   
                </p>    
                <p>3 days later, Hofmann self-experimented, dosing himself with .25 milligrams of LSD, assuming that would be a threshold dose*. One hour later, Albert Hofmann was experiencing the first LSD trip. After his trip, Hofmann knew he had discovered something of significance, that LSD a psychoactive substance with extraordinary potency, capable of causing significant shifts of consciousness in incredibly low doses.
                </p>    
                    Because of how intense and introspective LSD is, Hofmann believed it was the perfect tool for psychiatric use.
                    
                    LSD was introduced as a commercial medication, Delysid, for various psychiatric uses in 1947, and brought to the United States in 1949. The rest was history.
