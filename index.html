          The story of LSD begins with Albert Hofmann, a Swiss-born chemist. In
          1938, Hofmann was working at Sandoz Laboratories, studying the medical
          plant Drama maritime as well as ergot fungus, as part of a program to
          synthesize and purify the active constituents to be used as
          pharmaceuticals. When experimenting on creating respiratory and
          circulatory stimulants, Hofmann synthesized lysergic acid diethylamide
          (LSD).

          5 years after his initial discovery, Hofmann accidentally ingested LSD
          through his fingertips and felt a sudden change of consciousness:

          restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness. At home I lay down and
          sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated-like condition, characterized
          by an extremely stimulated imagination. In a dreamlike state, with
          eyes closed (I found the daylight to be unpleasantly glaring), I
          perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary
          shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colours.<span

          3 days later, Hofmann self-experimented, dosing himself with .25

          After his trip, Hofmann knew he had discovered something of
          significance, that LSD a psychoactive substance with extraordinary
          potency, capable of causing significant shifts of consciousness in
          incredibly low doses.

          Because of how intense and introspective LSD is, Hofmann believed it
          was the perfect tool for psychiatric use. LSD was introduced as a
          commercial medication, Delysid, for various psychiatric uses in 1947,
          and brought to the United States in 1949.

          After Hofmann's discovery, he spent the rest of his life as an
          advocate for LSD and its powerful, therapeutical and spiritual
          benefits for individuals. He felt that LSD was medicine for the soul.
          On April 29th, 2008, Albert Hofmann passed away at the age of 102.

          From the 1950s through the early 1970s, psychiatrists, therapists, and
          researchers administered LSD to thousands of people as a treatment for
          alcoholism, as well as for anxiety and depression in people with
          advanced stage cancer. Despite its beneficial properties, LSD became
          illegal in the 1970’s after being pushed to the streets and used and
          abused recreationally. Research and experiments were brought to a halt
          until the 1980’s.

      <h1 class="title-6">What is psychedelic-assisted therapy?</h1>
      <div class="psych-define">
        <p>
          Therapeutic practices that involve ingestion of psychedelic
          substances. Clinical trials have shown that ingesting a psychedelic in
          a carefully prescribed and monitored setting can induce an experience
          that is medically safe and that provokes profound, durable
          psychological and behavioural change. Interventions using psychedelics
          have shown promise as a treatment for alcohol dependence, nicotine
          dependence, anxiety related to a terminal illness, and chronic PTSD,
          and research is underway to examine its efficacy in relation to
          obsessive-compulsive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, and
          social anxiety related to autism, among other potential applications.

          LSD is known for its ability to catalyze spiritual or mystical
          experiences and to facilitate feelings of interconnection - focusing
          primarily on the treatment of anxiety associated with life-threatening
          illness, as well as for spiritual uses, creativity, and personal

          management of conditions such as treatment-resistant depression,
          various forms of anxiety, PTSD, and addiction. Psilocybin can catalyze

          Ayahuasca is a psychoactive brew or tea. Researchers have been
          exploring the effects of ayahuasca on brain function as well as the
          potential use of ayahuasca-assisted therapy as a treatment for
          substance abuse and other disorders. Current research suggests that
          ayahuasca may help reduce problematic substance use by helping promote
          personal or spiritual insights or self-knowledge.
